	My name is Skyler Young. I am a Computer Science student in my Senior year. 
	Courses Iâ€™ve taken include Software Engineering, Assembly Language & Computer Architecture, Data Structures, and Embedded Linux.
	Last semester, I collaborated on an e-learning website for my Software Engineering class and we managed to 
	make a working prototype.
	
	I am currently doing my Senior project. 
	I thought it would be a good idea to take this course because we are doing a web-based project,
	and it seemed like a Web Programming class would be a good complement to this.
	I could also see myself using this knowledge as a career web developer.
